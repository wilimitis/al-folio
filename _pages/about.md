Painter of psyreal nature spirits 🌀🍃

After serving society as a full-stack software engineer for 7 years, a series of entheogenic experiences showed me a journey to the heart requiring the peeling away of false layers and a rebirth of my creative spirit.

Embarking on this journey has led to me travel across the world seeking guidance in mind, body, and soul. At the Vienna Academy of Visionary art I studied under Stefan Lucas, Kuba Ambrose, Vera Antlantia, Peter Gric, Kevin Campeau, Olga Klimova, and Li Lian Kolster.

This led to the painting of interconnected nature energies inspired by a combination of meditative techniques which facilitate visualizing, communicating, and living various embodiments in flora, fauna, and divine entities. It is the hope that through this practice the veil will be lifted and humanity will feel inspired to look inward and reevaluate its connection with the natural world.
